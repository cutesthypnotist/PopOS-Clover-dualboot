# Installing Clover Script for Dual Boot Between PopOS and Windows 

## About

I just wanted to have a way to set up a comfy dual boot UI between PopOS and Windows that didn't hurt my head based on [ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-Dualboot](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot).

If you use this for some reason just be sure to change all instances of 'ims' (my username) to whatever username you have.
